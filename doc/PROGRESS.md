## 2026-03-19: Implement workflow system v0 — full stack

**What changed:**
- Backend: Hono server on Bun with project registry, workstream/progress scanning, file tree browsing, file read/write, multmux session integration, tmux terminal proxy via WebSocket, macOS desktop notifications, file watchers for real-time progress updates
- Frontend: Replaced all mock data with API hooks (polling). Added CodeMirror 6 markdown editor, xterm.js terminal component, workstream status management from Roadmap tab, progress dismiss from Monitor tab
- Removed unused legacy prototype components (AttentionQueue, DocWorkspace, RunConsole)
- Security hardening: input validation on session names, realpath-based path traversal protection, server-side write restriction to .md/.json, WebSocket origin check, configurable CORS, file locking on writes
- Created workstream.json + progress.json for the v0 workstream itself
- Seeded ~/.workflow/projects.json with the workflow repo

**Why:**
- Design doc was finalized. This is the first implementation pass turning the design into a working system. Priority was Monitor + notifications (biggest UX gap: manual polling), then Workspace (doc editor + terminal), then Roadmap.

**Key files:** server/src/*, ui/src/*, package.json, doc/todo/v0/workstream.json
**Verification:** `tsc -b --noEmit` clean, `vite build` succeeds, server starts and all API endpoints return correct data
**Commit:** 6987e05
**Next:** E2E testing with real multmux sessions, History sub-tab in Workspace sidebar, session-project mapping, session_idle desktop notifications
**Blockers:** None
