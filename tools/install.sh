# yaco binary. Builds the bun-compiled binary into $BIN_DIR, codesigns it on
# macOS when codesign is available, then delegates to `"$BIN_DIR/yaco" install
# "$@"` for the rest of the work (hooks, wrapper, symlinks, registry, doctor).
#
# Acceptance contract: this file MUST NOT contain a bare `yaco install` line —
# the delegation is by absolute path so a stale PATH cannot accidentally hit a
# legacy binary.

# command resolver in lib/core/agent/lifecycle reads YACO_BIN_DIR to write the
# canonical `<BIN_DIR>/yaco agent hook-event <Event>` form into provider
# configs. Without these envs, an install.sh invoked from /tmp would install
# /tmp into projects.json and write hook commands pointing at a fallback path.
